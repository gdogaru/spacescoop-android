        <p>Imagine a world where each season lasts over 100 years and you have three shadows at
            once.</p>
        <p>Now meet HD 131399ab, a newly discovered exo-planet with these exact quirks! (An
            exo-planet is a planet orbiting a distant star.)</p>
        <p>The strange new world was discovered orbiting a star in a triple star system. That means
            its parent star orbits alongside two other stars. This makes sunrises and
            sunsets something special &mdash; sometimes one sun rises in the sky, sometimes it&rsquo;s
            two or three!</p>
        <p>But despite this, this planet is not entirely unique.&nbsp;Many planets orbit stars that
            come in pairs&nbsp;or&nbsp;even triples. What is special about this new world is
            that astronomers spotted it directly. Others planets have been detected orbiting around
            double and triple stars, but these were all discovered using clever tricks, like
            carefully watching to see if <a

                    target="_blank">stars wobble</a>.</p>
        <p>More than 3,000 planets have been found orbiting distant stars, but less than 50 have
            been directly photographed. Spotting a tiny planet travelling around a distant star
            is like trying to find a mosquito flying in front of the midday sun.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, it looks like this exotic world might not survive for long.</p>
        <p>For planets to survive in a triple star system, a delicate balance must be struck. This
            planet&rsquo;s current orbit is roughly twice as large as Pluto&rsquo;s around
            our Sun, swinging it into a very unstable region of the system, just a bit too close to
            the spinning pair of stars.</p>
        <p>Because of this, the planet could be doomed to one of several wretched fates, including
            burning up as it hurtles towards one of the stars or being ejecting into deep
            space, destined to wander for eternity in the never-ending darkness.</p>
        <div class="cool-fact"><h3>Cool Fact</h3>
            <p>HD 131399ab is four times as massive as Jupiter and takes 550 Earth-years to complete
                one orbit around its star.</p></div>
