            <title>â€œAin&amp;#39;t No Sunshine When She&amp;#39;s Goneâ€</title>

            <description>


                &lt;p&gt;If you're a regular reader of Space Scoop, you've probably seen lots of
                exciting pictures of
                space by now. But you'll want to pay special attention to this fuzzy green blob,
                because this is the
                future fate of our Sun! (But don't worry, we've got another 5 billion years before
                this happens!)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The core of a star is a very intense environment.
                Gravity pushes down from
                all angles, creating
                immense pressure, and temperatures can reach over 15 million degrees! In these
                conditions, &amp;lsquo;nuclear
                fusion&amp;rsquo; can take place. This means that atoms can be fused (merged)
                together to create
                different chemicals. For example, four hydrogen atoms create a helium atom. When a
                star of a similar
                size to our Sun has burned all its fuel (hydrogen), it reaches the end of its life.
                In the very last
                phase, the star swells up to many times its original size. We call the result a red
                giant star.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The star has trouble holding on to all its material
                when it has grown this
                large, so a large
                amount of material from the star's outer shell blows off into space. Gas and dust
                shed by the star form
                what we call a planetary nebula. This green, glowing sphere is an example of one.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h3&gt;Cool Fact&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuclear fusion has been happening in the core
                of our own Sun for
                4.5 billion years now, and it will continue for another 5 billion years, at least!
                But eventually, just
                like the song, there'll be &amp;ldquo;no sunshine when she's gone&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>The Galactic Empire</title>
            <link>http://www.unawe.org/kids/unawe1326/</link>
            <description>


                &lt;p&gt;Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is more than just a giant barred&amp;nbsp;spiral
                containing hundreds
                of billions of stars. It's also the centre of a colossal empire and rules over about
                20 smaller galaxies
                that orbit around it, similar to the way our Moon orbits the Earth. The shining
                stars and glowing arcs
                of gas in this picture lie in one of these subjects: a dwarf galaxy called the Small
                Magellanic Cloud.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you live in the Southern Hemisphere or near
                the equator, you may have
                noticed two bright but
                blurry clouds in the dark night sky. The smaller of these clouds is the Small
                Magellanic Cloud, one of
                the Milky Way's so-called 'satellite galaxies'. It is a dwarf galaxy, meaning that
                it contains far fewer
                stars than galaxies similar to our own. While the Milky Way is made up of about 300
                billion stars, the
                Small Magellanic Cloud has just a couple of billion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a cosmic
                scale, this galaxy is extremely close by. Moving at the fastest
                speed known in the
                Universe (the speed of light), it would take less than 200 thousand years to travel
                there from Earth.
                This may not seem very close, but the galaxy we talked about in last week's &lt;a
                href="http://www.unawe.org/kids/unawe1324/" target="_blank"&gt;Space Scoop&lt;/a&gt;
                is 47 million years
                away if you're moving at the same speed!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Being so close to us,
                the Small Magellanic Cloud offers astronomers an
                opportunity to study
                phenomena that are difficult to examine in more distant galaxies. This picture shows
                an area of the
                galaxy called the 'Wings'. It contains three star clusters that astronomers have
                been studying recently
                to find out how young stars are born.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Cool Fact&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                Small Magellanic Cloud began its career
                as a barred spiral
                galaxy, similar to the Milky Way. Over time, the gravity from nearby galaxies has
                pulled it into the
                irregular, chaotic form we see today.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Rise and Shine, it&amp;#39;s Breakfast Time!</title>
            <link>http://www.unawe.org/kids/unawe1325/</link>
            <description>


                &lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, astronomers watched in amazement as a black hole woke up
                from a decades-long
                slumber and began tucking into a hearty breakfast. Not a croissant or a bowl of
                cereal, but a
                super-Jupiter! A super-Jupiter is an object that is much larger than Jupiter (the
                largest planet in our
                Solar System), but not big enough to be a star. In this case, about 30 times larger.
                To put this into
                perspective, the Earth would fit inside Jupiter over 1300 times!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Picture
                the scene: a group of astronomers from the European Space Agency
                were settled in for a
                night of observing, when a mysterious bright X-ray flare suddenly blazed its way
                onto their screens.
                Curious to find out where this mysterious light was coming from, the astronomers
                traced it back to its
                source. It was coming from the centre of a known galaxy called NGC 4845. This galaxy
                has been observed
                many times, but on this night, it was shining over 1000 times brighter than normal!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The light came from heated material around the galaxy&amp;rsquo;s central
                &lt;a
                href="http://www.unawe.org/kids/unawe1116/" target="_blank"&gt;black hole&lt;/a&gt;,
                as it tore apart
                and fed on the unfortunate object. The black hole in the centre of NGC 4845 is
                estimated to have a mass
                of around 300 000 times that of our own Sun. It also likes to play with its food:
                for over 2&amp;ndash;3
                months, it toyed with the object before munching down about a tenth of its material!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;You can watch a computer simulation of the event &lt;a

                horizon. It is at this point that everything, even light, must go toward the black
                hole. There is no
                escape once you've crossed the event horizon!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>A Case of Mistaken Identity</title>
            <link>http://www.unawe.org/kids/unawe1324/</link>
            <description>


                &lt;p&gt;What do you see when you look at this space picture?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If
                you answered 'a galaxy', or better yet, 'a spiral galaxy', you're right!
                But can you believe
                that not once, but twice, this galaxy has been misidentified by professional
                astronomers? When it was
                first observed by Pierre M&amp;eacute;chain way back in 1780, he thought it was a
                nebula (a glowing
                cloud of gas and dust). Then, a few years later, Charles Messier called it a 'star
                cluster', which is a
                group of a few thousand or million stars bound together by gravity (far less stars
                than in a galaxy).
                Nevermind Charles, you were only wrong by a few 100 billion stars!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But
                before we judge Pierre and Charles too harshly, we have to remember
                that telescopes were
                still quite a new invention in the 1700s. Comparing the quality of early telescopes
                to the Hubble Space
                Telescope is like comparing a toy car to a Ferrari. Can you believe it was less than
                100 years ago that
                we found out there are other galaxies in the Universe than our own? These days, we
                know the Universe
                contains hundreds of billions of star-filled galaxies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These
                galaxies come in all different shapes, sizes and types. This picture
                doesn't just show a
                spiral-shaped galaxy , this is also the closest example of a 'Seyfert galaxy'. This
                is an extremely
                energetic type of galaxy that is full of hot, glowing gas and ejects huge amounts of
                intense radiation
                from its dark core.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Cool Fact&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a single
                image of a tiny patch of the
                night sky, Hubble
                photographed thousands of galaxies! You can see this picture&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://www.unawe.org/resources/images/XDF/" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
                Doesn't it make you
                realise just how gigantic the Universe is?&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>


                &lt;p&gt;The Universe is an old neighbourhood; it's about 13.8 billion years old.
                Our galaxy, the Milky
                Way, is also ancient, some of its stars are more than 13 billion years old. But it's
                still a lively
                place, with new objects forming and others being destroyed. In this image, you can
                see a group of young
                newcomers to our solar neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But how young are these
                stellar kids really? It turns out that their exact
                ages are uncertain,
                but astronomers think that they range from 20 to 35 million years old. That doesn't
                sound very young at
                all, does it? Then again, our Sun is 4600 million years old, and it hasn't even
                reached middle age yet.
                This means that if you imagine that the Sun is a 40-year-old person, the bright
                stars in the picture are
                three-month-old babies!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most stars don't form alone. They are
                born with tens or thousands of other
                stars, in
                'clusters'. All the stars in a cluster are born from the same material at around the
                same time. This
                picture shows an 'open' star cluster. These usually live just a short time, before
                the stars begin to
                drift apart forever. But there's something odd about this cluster: there are one or
                two yellow and red
                stars, which are much older. Can you spot them?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Cool Fact&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div
                class="archives_extra_info"&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the oldest open clusters known is
                Messier 67. It is a whopping 3.7
                billion years old!
                Astronomers think it has lived for so long because it lies in an isolated part of
                the Milky Way, so
                there aren&amp;rsquo;t any heavy space objects around to pull its stars apart!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

            <description>


                &lt;p&gt;Ever imagined travelling back to the beginning of time or seeing the entire
                Universe? Well, you
                can do all of that just by looking at this picture! The space telescope, Planck, has
                been observing the
                oldest light in the world, from just after the beginning of the Universe! These
                observations have now
                been collected into this map, showing the shape of the Universe when it was very
                young. The blue and red
                splotches you can see are the ancient &amp;lsquo;seeds&amp;rsquo; of today&amp;rsquo;s
                stars and
                galaxies!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most astronomers believe the Universe began with a
                &amp;lsquo;Big Bang&amp;rsquo;
                13.7 billion
                years ago. Before this, the entire Universe was squashed inside a bubble thousands
                of times smaller than
                a pinhead. Then, it suddenly exploded, and the Universe we know was born. The faint
                glow of light
                collected by Planck is called cosmic microwave background radiation. It fills the
                whole Universe,
                surrounding Earth in every direction. Some call it an &amp;lsquo;echo of the Big
                Bang&amp;rsquo;,
                because it was the first light to exist in the Universe after its explosive
                beginning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists now say the blotchy pattern on this map is
                solid proof of the
                Big Bang theory, only
                it actually happened 13.8 billion years ago. This means that the Universe is 80
                million years older than
                we believed!On top of this spectacular new finding, the map contains some curious
                mysteries: Why are
                there more hot, red splotches in the bottom half of the map? What caused the big
                cold spot in the
                middle? Maybe, one day, you will be the one to solve these mysteries!&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;!-- Cool Fact was here --&gt;

                &lt;h3&gt;Cool Fact&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cosmic microwave background radiation was
                blisteringly hot when
                it was first created, but over the last 13 billion years, it has cooled
                dramatically. Today, it is just
                2.7 degrees above absolute zero &amp;mdash; the coldest temperature possible (&amp;minus;273&amp;deg;C).&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>


                &lt;p&gt;Back in 1999, this galaxy was floating peacefully through space without a
                care in the world.
                Then all of a sudden, this calm was shattered by a spectacular explosion. It was the
                fiery death of a
                massive star, one of the most violent events in nature. We call these explosions
                'supernovae', and this
                one was bright enough to outshine the rest of its galaxy combined!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This
                stunning view of the nearby galaxy was captured by astronomers
                studying the after-effects
                of the explosion. They saw the supernova's brightness gently fading through the
                years. It has dimmed so
                much that the once-vivid supernova can barely be seen in this picture. Despite the
                supernova being so
                faint, astronomers have still managed to reveal some details about the star that
                exploded. And it was
                enormous before its death &amp;mdash; more than eight times bigger than our Sun!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This space picture might not show the bright light of the supernova, but it
                does reveal some
                interesting features. This galaxy is known as a &amp;lsquo;spiral galaxy&amp;rsquo;,
                like the Milky Way.
                Named so because of the loosely wound spiral-shape arms that can be seen wrapping
                around the bright
                galaxy centre. The spiral arms in this picture are highlighted by a bright pattern
                of blue young stars,
                glowing gas clouds and dark dust lanes.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;!-- Cool Fact was here --&gt;

                &lt;h3&gt;Cool Fact&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One supernova can create more energy than the
                Sun will throughout
                its entire lifetime. And our Sun will live to be about 10 billion years old!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>The Star That Lived Two Lives</title>
            <link>http://www.unawe.org/kids/unawe1320/</link>
            <description>


                &lt;p&gt;In 1604, a new star appeared in the night sky. It shone brighter than all
                the other stars and
                for three weeks it was even visible during the day! This mysterious beacon marked
                the explosive death of
                a nearby star. These explosions are called supernova, and they give off so much
                light that for a few
                weeks, they can outshine a galaxy of billions of stars! Then slowly they fade away,
                leaving behind
                beautiful glowing clouds of gas, like the one in this picture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But
                let's travel back to a few millions years earlier, because the story of
                this star gets even
                more interesting. The star that exploded in 1604 began its life as an average star,
                similar to our Sun.
                When an average-sized star dies, the result is much less dramatic than a powerful
                supernova. Instead of
                exploding, they collapse. The material from the centre of the star ends up squashed
                tightly down into a
                tiny, heavy ball called a white dwarf star.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is how this star
                died for the first time, long before 1604. But how
                did it end up dying a
                second time? Well, astronomers have recently discovered the answer to that question.
                The white dwarf had
                a companion, an enormous red giant star. Even though the red giant was much larger,
                the white dwarf&amp;rsquo;s
                gravity was much stronger. It began to rip gas off its companion, pulling the
                material onto itself.
                Eventually the star's own greed led to its demise. It stole so much material that it
                became unstable,
                leading to the spectacular explosion that our ancestors saw!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More
                Information:&lt;/strong&gt; The astronomers who made
                this discovery have
                created a video showing a simulation of the supernova explosion; you can &lt;a
                href="http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2013/kepler/animations.html" target="_blank"&gt;watch
                it here&lt;/a&gt; and get an amazing close-up view of one of the most explosive
                events in nature!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>The Search for our Cosmic Origins Begins</title>
            <link>http://www.unawe.org/kids/unawe1319/</link>
            <description>


                &lt;p&gt;Today, a brand new telescope called ALMA opened its eyes. This gigantic
                telescope is the
                biggest in the world: it is made up of fifty-four 12-metre dish antennas (about the
                height of a
                four-storey building!) and twelve, slightly smaller antennas of 7 metres. These 66
                dishes will all work
                together to create the most powerful telescope on the face of the Earth! ALMA can
                capture light from
                some of the most distant objects in the cosmos, to show us never before seen details
                from the early
                Universe. This awesome picture shows the ALMA telescope sprawled across the Atacama
                Desert in Chile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the Universe was very young, it was filled
                with a &lt;a
                href="http://www.unawe.org/kids/unawe1137/" target="_blank"&gt;thick fog&lt;/a&gt;
                of cold hydrogen gas.
                This makes it difficult to study with normal &amp;lsquo;visible light&amp;rsquo;
                telescopes. But ALMA
                has special eyes that will view the cosmos in a different light known as 'radio
                light&amp;rsquo;. This
                will allow the telescope to pierce through the fog and reveal the secrets beyond for
                the first time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ALMA will also shed light on some of the coldest
                objects in the Universe.
                It will peer through
                dark clouds of gas and dust that are just a few degrees above absolute zero &amp;mdash;
                the coldest
                possible temperature (&amp;minus;273&amp;deg;C). Trying to get colder would be like
                trying to walk south
                from the South Pole! We hope to uncover exotic new planets orbiting alien suns and
                bright baby stars
                being formed inside the thick clouds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you want to be the first
                to know the secrets ALMA unveils about our
                cosmic origins, make
                sure to read Space Scoop in the coming months!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- Cool Fact was here
                --&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Cool Fact&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALMA has been constructed 5000-metres
                high on
                a mountain in the
                Atacama Desert, Chile, one of the driest places on Earth! The immense height and
                dryness of the location
                means there's very little cloud cover to disrupt observations. But at 5000 metres,
                the air is extremely
                thin, so human access is kept to an absolute minimum!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>What&amp;#39;s the Matter?</title>
            <link>http://www.unawe.org/kids/unawe1318/</link>
            <description>


                &lt;p&gt;Matter makes up everything you can see: the stars, the Earth, even you!
                Matter itself is made
                up of lots and lots of different kinds of teeny tiny particles, all stuck together.
                Some of these
                particles are called atoms. These come in many shapes and sizes &amp;mdash; there's
                hydrogen, helium,
                and, one of the most important atoms, carbon. Carbon is the second most common
                material in the human
                body (after oxygen). To give you an idea of just how small an atom is: it would take
                a million atoms
                lined up to equal the thickness of a sheet of paper!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This
                weird-looking picture shows a number of molecules (Moll-eh-kyools),
                which are groups of
                two or more atoms stuck together. Molecules are so small that nobody can see them,
                except with extremely
                powerful microscopes. The football shaped molecules in this picture are made up of
                60 carbon atoms,
                hence its name &amp;ldquo;C60&amp;rdquo;. Carbon is a very important chemical for
                all life on Earth. Is
                a big part of the world we live in, from the carbon dioxide in the air to the plants
                we eat. And almost
                one-fifth of our body is made up of carbon!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But where does this
                magic element come from? Well, it comes from stars! All
                of the carbon in
                the universe was made inside stars. After a star has changed all of the hydrogen
                atoms at its core into
                helium, it begins to convert the helium atoms into carbon and other atoms (like
                oxygen). When the stars
                die, these newly forged chemicals are cast out into space to be recycled as new
                stars, planets or even
                people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, C60 appears to be very rare in space. This is
                very peculiar as
                carbon is the fourth
                most common chemical in the entire Universe (after hydrogen, helium and oxygen).
                Additionally, C60 has
                proven very easy to create in labs on Earth. Now, after many observations, the
                mystery has been solved:
                this particular carbon molecule only forms in parts of the cosmos that are very rich
                in carbon and where
                the strong winds coming from a nearby energetic star can mould it into being.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;!-- Cool Fact was here --&gt;

                &lt;h3&gt;Cool Fact&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbon is essential for life on Earth &amp;mdash;
                it is found in
                all living organisms. So it's strange that too much carbon in our atmosphere is
                dangerous to us &amp;mdash;
                today it is a huge cause of global warming! Tonnes of carbon dioxide being released
                into the atmosphere
                come from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. This is changing our
                climate in a dramatic
                way. So do your part and make sure you aren't wasting any energy: turn your
                electronic devices off when
                they're not in use, recycle and ride your bike to school!&lt;/p&gt;
