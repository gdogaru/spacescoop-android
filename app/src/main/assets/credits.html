    UNAWE (Universe Awareness) use the beauty and grandeur of the Universe to inspire young children
    and encourage them to develop an interest in science and technology. The programme also aims to
    introduce children to
    the idea of global citizenship and tolerance at a crucial stage of their development â€“ to show
    them that they are
    part of an international community.

    Until the advent of UNAWE, there were no large scale attempts to use astronomy as a tool for
    inspiring and educating young children. Therefore, while our resources are open to all, the
    programme is aimed at
    children aged 4 to 10 years, especially those from underprivileged communities.
