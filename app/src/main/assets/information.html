UNAWE (Universe Awareness) use the beauty and grandeur of the Universe to inspire young children and
encourage them to
develop an interest in science and technology. The programme also aims to introduce children to the
idea of global
citizenship and tolerance at a crucial stage of their development â€“ to show them that they are part
of an international
community.
Until the advent of UNAWE, there were no large scale attempts to use astronomy as a tool for
inspiring and educating
young children. Therefore, while our resources are open to all, the programme is aimed at children
aged 4 to 10 years,
especially those from underprivileged communities.
